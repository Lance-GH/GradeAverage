# GradeAverage
A counter-controlled grade-average determiner

This little C program uses a counter to determine the number of inputs to be read from the command line and continously adds the input values to a total 
value that would have initially been set to zero. Finally, it divides the summed total by the number of inputs, i.e. the counter, to calculate the average.
